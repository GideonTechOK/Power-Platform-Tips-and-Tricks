### What are the CoE Core Components?

The **Center of Excellence Core Components** are a set of foundational tools and resources designed to help administrators govern and monitor Power Platform usage within an organization. This includes:

- **Environment and App Management**: Track environments, app creators, makers, and usage across your organization.
- **User and App Insights**: Monitor activity to understand user adoption, usage patterns, and areas where support may be needed.
- **Data Policies and Compliance**: Set guardrails on the data your makers can access, and ensure compliance with organizational standards.
- **Security and User Access**: Ensure users are accessing Power Platform resources securely, following your organizationâ€™s policies.

### Why Install the CoE Core Components?

The CoE Core Components provide essential oversight that benefits any organization using Power Platform. Hereâ€™s why installing these components is crucial:

1. **Enhanced Governance**: The CoE Core Components enable you to manage Power Platform applications, flows, and makers in a way that aligns with your organizationâ€™s governance policies.
2. **Data-Driven Insights**: These components give administrators valuable insights into platform usage, helping identify trends and opportunities for improvement.
3. **Compliance Assurance**: Set data and security policies that limit access to sensitive data, ensuring your Power Platform usage meets compliance requirements.

### Why You Should Keep the CoE Core Updated

Updating the CoE Core Components regularly is vital to ensure your CoE continues to provide relevant and effective governance for Power Platform usage. Here are the top reasons to keep it updated:

1. **New Features and Capabilities**: Microsoft regularly enhances the CoE Starter Kit with new features that support improved governance, analytics, and monitoring capabilities.
   
2. **Bug Fixes and Stability Improvements**: Each update includes fixes for known issues, improving the reliability and performance of your CoE.
